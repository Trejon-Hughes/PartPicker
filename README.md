# PC Part Picker

This website is a concept that allows an admin account to create various PC parts and an enduser to be able to select parts from those created and be notified of potential compatability issues.

- CRUD functionality with a decent UI
- Notifications when actions could and couldn't be completed
- Altered views based on if a user is logged in or not

There are various features that could be added or fleshed out more from here
